# multi-threaded-data-crypter

**Overview**
MultiThreaded Data Crypter is a Java application that efficiently processes and decrypts complex data records from an input file. It leverages multithreading for concurrent execution of data parsing, decryption, and password extraction tasks. 

**Features**
- Multithreaded Processing: Efficiently processes data records using Java's multithreading capabilities, improving performance.
- Data Transformation: Converts raw text records into structured data using robust algorithms.
- Cryptographic Decryption: Decrypts encrypted data within records, adhering to predefined rules.
- Data Validation: Implements data validation checks to ensure data integrity and adherence to specified patterns and rules.
- File I/O: Demonstrates strong file handling skills for reading and processing data from external files.
- Exception Handling: Implements effective exception handling for error resilience and application stability.
- Getting Started
- To run the application locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Open the project in your preferred Java development environment (e.g., VS Code, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
- Build and run the Driver.java file to start the application.

**Usage**
- Prepare an input file (xyz.txt) with the data records to be processed. Ensure the data is formatted as specified in the project.
- Run the application, and it will process the input data, perform decryption, and output the results.
- Review the output to see the decrypted data and validation status.
